/**
 * RunnableCmd is a utility class that implements Runnable to execute system commands
 * in a separate thread. It supports both single command strings and command arrays,
 * and can optionally execute commands in a specified working directory. The class
 * captures and prints the standard output of the executed process to the console.
 * <p>
 * Usage scenarios include launching external applications, scripts, or batch files
 * from within the GLIMPSE Scenario Builder GUI, while keeping the main application
 * responsive. This class is not intended for capturing process output for further
 * programmatic use, but rather for simple command execution and output logging.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *   RunnableCmd rc = new RunnableCmd();
 *   rc.setCmd("myScript.bat", "C:/my/dir");
 *   new Thread(rc).start();
 * </pre>
 *
