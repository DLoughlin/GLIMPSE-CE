 * ExecutionThread manages the execution of background tasks (commands, runnables, callables) using an ExecutorService and tracks their status for the GLIMPSE Scenario Builder.
 * <p>
 * <b>Key Features:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Supports both single-threaded and multi-threaded execution modes for background jobs.</li>
 *   <li>Allows submission of command-line jobs, Runnable, and Callable tasks, with or without working directories.</li>
 *   <li>Tracks all submitted jobs and provides methods to check completion, clean up finished jobs, and retrieve job status.</li>
 *   <li>Integrates with a StatusChecker to monitor and report job progress.</li>
 *   <li>Provides thread-safe methods for job submission, status checking, and shutdown operations.</li>
 *   <li>Implements AutoCloseable for use in try-with-resources blocks.</li>
 *   <li>Includes deprecated methods for backward compatibility with legacy code.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b> Instantiate and start the executor using {@link #startUpExecutorSingle()} or {@link #startUpExecutorMulti()}, then submit jobs using the provided methods. Call {@link #shutdown()} or use try-with-resources to ensure proper cleanup.
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> All public methods are thread-safe unless otherwise noted. The jobs list is synchronized for all access.
